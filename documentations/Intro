Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to **build, package, and run applications in lightweight, portable containers**. 

### **Why Docker?**
Traditionally, developers faced challenges with **"It works on my machine"** issues due to different environments. Docker solves this by **containerizing applications** along with their dependencies, ensuring they run consistently across different platforms.

### **Key Features of Docker:**
1. **Portability:** Docker containers run the same way on any system (Windows, macOS, Linux, or cloud).
2. **Lightweight:** Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more efficient than virtual machines.
3. **Scalability:** Easily scale applications by running multiple container instances.
4. **Rapid Deployment:** Start or stop containers in seconds.
5. **Isolation:** Each container runs independently, avoiding conflicts between applications.

### **How Does It Work?**
Docker uses a **Dockerfile** to define an application's environment and dependencies. It builds this into an **image**, which can be run as a **container**.

#### **Example: Running a Simple Web Server with Docker**
1. **Create a file named `Dockerfile`:**
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.9
   COPY app.py /app/app.py
   WORKDIR /app
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```
2. **Build and run the container:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-python-app .
   docker run -p 5000:5000 my-python-app
   ```

Now, the application runs inside an isolated container, and you can access it via `http://localhost:5000`.
